	* Intro *

This README contains instructions for setting up, building and running
different parts of the project.

List of currently covered topics:

- Parser.
- Report.



	* Parser *

The parser uses ANTLR to parse the input into the internal data structure.
The currently used version is v3.2-4. At least v3.1 is required[2010-10-13],
though this is subject to change. Below is setup instructions for Debian testing:

1:	Install antlr3 ("aptitude install antlr3" should suffice).
2:	Link the build process with 3 jar-files: "antlr3.jar", "antlr3-runtime.jar"
	and "stringtemplate.jar". The system location should be "/usr/share/java"
3:	(Optional): To build the lexer and parser from the grammar, the following line can be used:
	java -cp /usr/share/java/antlr3.jar:/usr/share/java/antlr3-runtime.jar:/usr/share/java/stringtemplate.jar org.antlr.Tool [NameOfGrammar.g]
	or the shell script "build_parser.sh".
	This process should probably be included in a build script if one is made.



	* Report *

The report is written in latex, and the pdf can be regenerated by using the following command
in the "report/tex" directory:
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode report.tex
or the shell script "generate_report_pdf.sh".
Please remember to run the command twice, to ensure that everything is built correctly.
