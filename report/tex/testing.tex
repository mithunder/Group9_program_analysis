\section{Test method}

The general test method regarding the transformations and analyses
is manual testing and automated regression testing. The regression
test is based on the tester writing an expected output, computing the
result, and comparing the two. While regression testing is not optimal,
since it may give false positives, it is deemed acceptable for this
project, especially since better testing is outside the scope of this
project.

In the following sections, the test instructions, examples and results
are generally presented in the appendix, unless they are interesting or
needs to be discussed in some way.
