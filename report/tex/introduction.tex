This report documents a project regarding the
Guarded Command Language (GCL), presented in the course 02242
Program Analysis, DTU, in the fall of 2010.
The project goal is to design, implement and test
a program analysis for GCL, including a parser,
worklist algorithm, several analyses and transformations.
As part of the project, a comparison between the Succint Solver
presented in the course and the implemented worklist algorithm
must be made and documented.
The project has been implemented in Java.
